Take a look at the package.json inside frontend and backend to see all the dependencies.
But I will highlight some crucial inclusions here.

| Frontend         |            |
|------------------|------------|
| frontend framework | React |


| Backend          |            |
|------------------|------------|
| backend framework| node.js    |
| HTTP, routing    | express.js |
| database         | MongoDB    |
| API              | graphql    |
| ORM              | prisma     |
| authentication   | passport.js|
